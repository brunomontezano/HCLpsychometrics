<!-- badges: end -->

The objective of `HCLpsychometrics` is to provide functions to perform the analyzes used in a study on the factor structure of the HCL-32 instrument in a population sample. The package has functions for executing routines for confirmatory factor analysis and ordinal alpha
coefficient estimation. 

## Installation

The current version can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("brunomontezano/HCLpsychometrics")
```

## Examples

```{r}
library(HCLpsychometrics)

# First, the models to be tested are created
created_models <- create_models()

# Then, we can fit these models on given dataset
# that contains yX as variable names, X being numbers from 1 to 32
fitted_models <- fit_models(
  data = hcl,
  models = created_models
)

# Finally, I could for example, summarize the parameters
# (In this case, I just printed the first 3 rows to save space)
summarize_parameters(
  fits = fitted_models
  ) %>% purrr::map(head, 3)

```
