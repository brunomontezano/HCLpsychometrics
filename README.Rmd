The objective of `HCLpsychometrics` is to provide functions to perform the analyzes used in a study on the factor structure of the HCL-32 instrument in a population sample. The package has functions for executing routines for confirmatory factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha
coefficient estimation. 

#### Note

This repository is not intended to be used by others. It is a package aggregating several tools used to replicate the specific analysis of an article. The dataset named `hcl` inside the package contains an example tibble (10% of the original sample) to check the proper functioning and give an idea on how the package works.

## Installation

The current version can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("brunomontezano/HCLpsychometrics")
```

## Examples

### Confirmatory Factor Analysis

```{r}
library(HCLpsychometrics)

# First, the models to be tested are created
created_models <- create_models()

# Then, we can fit these models on given dataset
# that contains yX as variable names, X being numbers from 1 to 32
fitted_models <- fit_models(
  data = hcl,
  models = created_models
)

# Finally, I could for example, summarize the parameters
# (In this case, I just printed the first 3 rows to save space)
summarize_parameters(
  fits = fitted_models
  ) %>% purrr::map(head, 3)
```

As can be seen from the output of the functions, they work in order to fit three models for CFA: a model by Bech et al. (2011), another by Forty et al. (2010) and a third model called HCL-28, developed by the authors of the paper. 

## Cronbach's Alpha

```{r}
# The alpha_hcl28 function can be used to calculate Cronbach's
# alpha based on the HCL-28 model in the input dataset
HCLpsychometrics::alpha_hcl28(hcl)
```

As you can see from the output, the `alpha_hcl28` function generates
Cronbach's alpha for the structure (HCL-28) as a whole, and separately
by factor.
